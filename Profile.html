	<h2>Myers-Briggs personality test </h2>
	<img src="Myers-Briggs Personality test.png" width="850" height="500">
	<h3>What does the results of the test mean for you?</h3>
	<p>In the mind category it says that I am 75% introverted meaning that 75% of the time I prefer solitary activities and get exhausted by social interaction. This means that I need alone time to regenerate my energy and I am quite introspective. In the energy category it says that I am 70% observant meaning that 70% of the time I am practical, pragmatic and down to earth focusing on past and present events. In the nature category it states that I am 65% thinking meaning that I focus on objectivity, rationality and prioritizing logic over emotion. It also means that I hide my emotions and see efficiency as more important than cooperation. In the tactics category it states that I am 51% judging meaning that I value clarity, predictability and closure therefore preferring structure and planning to spontaneity. In the Identity category it states that I am 54% turbulent meaning that I am 54% self-conscious and sensitive to stress and 54% success driven. </p>
	<h3>How do you think these results would influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
	<p>I think that being 75% introverted would negatively affect my ability to communicate with my other team members as I would keep to myself and avoid sharing my ideas. I think that being 70% observant would help me to focus on the current task at hand in a team but may also hinder my ability to look to the future for more ideas. I think that being 65% thinking would help me make decisions in my team that are supported by rationality and logic but that could lead to some conflicting arguments with team members who prioritise emotion over logic and rationality. I think that being 51% judging would mean that I would make sure that each member in the team would have a role and task and ensure that we are all working towards the same goal. I think that being 54% turbulent would mean that I would be second guessing all the decisions I have made in the team and if there are any setbacks of the task, I would be prone to stress. </p>
	<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
	<p>To consider my introverted nature I would ensure that my other team members are more extroverted and are more able to share their ideas which would help to motivate me to share my own ideas.  To consider my observant energy I would make sure to find other team members that have intuitive energy so that they can focus on future ideas to account for my lack of imagination and focus on the past and present. To consider my thinking nature I would make sure that my other team members also have a thinking nature so that we can all make decisions focused on rationality and logic rather than just going with emotion which would avoid any conflicts. To consider my judging tactics I would ensure that my other teammates also value clarity have a clear task and set of goals with aligned interest.  To consider my turbulent identity I would make sure to get teammates that are more assertive and are less prone to stress so that if we were to encounter a setback the whole team would not be stressed. </p>
	<h3>Critique of validity and interpretation of results</h3>
	<p>I believe that most of the results from the personality test are accurate. However, I believe that I am more 50% judging and 50% prospecting rather than 51% judging as I feel that there are times that I value structure but also times when I cannot be bothered to have any structure. In terms of interpretation, I do feel that it is also accurate and fitting to my personality. </p>
	<h2>Education planner learning style test </h2>
	<img src="Education Planner Learning Style Test.png" width="850" height="500">
	<h3>What does the results of the test mean for you?</h3>
	<p>In terms of learning styles, it states that I am 41.2% theorist style meaning that I like to think through problems in a logical manner and value rationality and objectivity. It states that I am 41.2% reflector style which means that I like to stand back and observe while collecting and analysing information to help reach conclusions. It means that I focus on the past and present experience to develop conclusions. It states that I have a 17.7% pragmatist style of learning. This means that I need to see how what I am learning can be put into practice into the real world. Therefore, I fail to see any use in abstract concepts and act quickly on ideas, focusing on getting straight to the point. </p>
	<h3>How do you think these results would influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
	<p>Being 41.2% theorist style would mean that I would ensure the decisions I make in the team about the project would be support by rationality and logic which may conflict with other team members who focus on feeling. Being 41.2% reflector style would mean that in a team I would be the one to stand back and collect information while the others would be putting ideas into practice.  Being 17.7% pragmatist would mean that I would tend to avoid lengthy discussions with team members and rather putting focus into putting ideas into practice. </p>
	<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
	<p>When forming a team, I would make sure that the other team members also like to focus on making decisions with logic and rationality to avoid any conflicts. I would also make sure that other team members are more pragmatic and want to put their ideas into practice to account for my lack of practical action. This would also ensure that we put out ideas into practice faster with less lengthy discussions. </p>
	<h3>Critique of validity and interpretation of results</h3>
	<p>I think that being 41.2% theorist is a valid result as I believe that I do focus on logic and rationality the most. However, I believe I should be more around 29.4% reflector style and 29.4% pragmatic style as I find equal value in standing back and collecting information and putting ideas into action. </p>
	<h2>Big five factors test </h2>
	<img src="Big Five Factors.png" width="950" height="300">
	<h3>What does the results of the test mean for you?</h3>
	<p>On factor 1 it states that I scored low on extroversion at the 25th percentile meaning that I tend to be less outgoing and social. On factor 2 it states that I scored high on emotional stability at the 66th percent meaning that I am less likely to have anxiety, worry and other negative emotions.  On factor 3 it states that I scored low on agreeableness at the 5th percentile meaning that I am more critical and aggressive to other people. On factor 4 I scored high on conscientiousness at the 62nd percentile meaning that I am more careful and diligent rather than impulsive and disorganized.  On factor 5 I scored low on imagination at the 6th percentile meaning that I am less open to experience and rather tend to be more traditional and conventional therefore avoiding too much innovation. </p>
	<h3>How do you think these results would influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
	<p>Due to scoring low on extroversion I would have minimal communication with my teammates and would avoid discussions. Due to scoring high on emotional stability I would be able to avoid stressing out on projects and would be able to stay focused when completing them. Due to scoring low on agreeableness I would be less likely to take any ideas from my teammates and would only pursue my own ideas leading some potential conflicts. Due to scoring high on conscientiousness I would make decisions carefully and make plans to delegate tasks and goals to keep the project organized. Due to scoring low on imagination I would avoid thinking of any ideas that would be too “out of the box” and more on well established conventions and ideas which may lead to me shutting down the ideas of my teammates. </p>
	<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
	<p>When forming a team, I would need to ensure that my teammates are more extroverted to push more discussion and idea sharing otherwise I would not be pushed to share my ideas. I need teammates that have high emotional stability so that we can avoid stress and keep our focus on the project. Due to scoring low on agreeableness I would need other teammates that score highly on agreeableness to ensure that the communication between team members is more friendly. I would need teammates that also care about planning out and delegating tasks so that we can all be working towards the same goal. My other teammate should have a higher imagination to compensate for my lack of imagination and share innovative ideas with the team. </p>
	<h3>Critique of validity and interpretation of results</h3>
	<p>I believe that the low extroversion and high emotional stability are accurate as I do enjoy my alone time and rarely feel anxious. However, I disagree with the low score on agreeableness as I believe that I am quite accommodating and friendly to people.  I agree with the high score on conscientiousness as I think that I like to know what I’m doing in a project rather than moving about aimlessly. I disagree with the low score on imagination as I think that I am quite open to new ideas, and I would be happy to hear ideas from my teammates. </p>
