  <h1>Interest in IT<h1>
	<h2>• What is your interest in IT? </h2>
	<p>My main interest in IT would be around of the field of cybersecurity. I have recently become interested in how our data is stored and protected from cyber attackers. I would want to ensure that the data that I have stored on my devices remains protected and only viewable by me. Cybersecurity would also cover the recovery of data and systems from cyberattacks which I think is important. Another area of IT that I have interest in would be the programming and development aspect of IT. I find the process of creating, designing, deploying and supporting of software interesting in the field of software development. I also find game development interesting as the level of freedom provided by game creation software such as unity and unreal engine is quite exciting. </p>
	<br>
	<h2>• When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h2>
	<p>My interest in IT started with regards to cybersecurity during year 11 when I was completing my software development subject. In this subject we learnt about the different ways flows of data could be interrupted/intercepted by attackers to steal or alter data. We also learnt about how privacy laws applied to the distribution and storage of user personal data. As a result, this sparked my interest in cybersecurity. In addition to this, hearing about how Facebook had been selling user personal information to advertisers and other partners to show users personalized ads put into perspective that it is very easy to access user personal information whether it be through legitimate means or illegitimate and therefore cybersecurity is very important in protecting user data. In terms of my interest in software development it would have also come from year 11 during my software development subject. In this subject we were tasked with creating websites and applications using HTML and Python. I found creating these quite fun which sparked my interest in software development. For game development watching youtubers such as Fundy and Dani create games or modifications for games sparked my interesting in game development.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>• Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </h2> 
	<p>While I do have my certain interests in IT, I wanted to experience the other areas of IT to find out if there were other areas that I would be more interested in pursuing as a career. As a result, I came upon the bachelor of Information Technology course at RMIT which seemed to offer a quite expansive overview of Information Technology. Monash University did have a similar course but I found that the campus location was too far away from my current living location and therefore would be inconvenient to go to. Melbourne University offered no such IT course other than the specific computer science and software development course which I saw as too narrow and not flexible enough for my liking. In addition to this, my brother and cousins also studied at RMIT and I also wanted to follow in their footsteps.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>• What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>
	<p>During my bachelor of information technology course, I expect to learn which major stream of IT that I am the most interested in pursuing a career for. I expect to learn a bit about each of the major streams such as web and mobile computing, security and cloud computing, data management, software systems development, analysis, AI and systems administration. I expect to develop and learn practical skills that can be applied to future employment for at least two of the major streams. At the moment I am considering security and cloud computing and systems administration as the two major streams that I am most interested in. </p>
