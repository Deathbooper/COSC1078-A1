  <h1>Project Ideas<h1>
	<h2>Overview: </h2>
	<p>The project will consist of creating a small device that a person carries with them that could be pinned to their clothing or placed in their bags. The phone would track the location of the device and calculate the distance between the device and the phone and once the device exceeds a set distance from the phone it will emit a beeping sound to inform the person that they have left their phone behind. This would prevent users from forgetting to pick up their phone after they have placed it down. The other part of the project would be the development of an app that a user could use to set the distance at which the device would emit a beeping sound to personalize it to meet their needs. </p>
	<h2>Motivation: </h2>
	<p>Currently there are 6.64 billion users of smartphones in the world today which makes up 83.72% of the world’s population. Therefore, there is a huge market for a smartphone tracker. It is common for people to place their phones on the table or their seat while they are sitting down to be more comfortable, for example they would leave their phones on the table at a restaurant so that they can sit down and eat their food. With this comes the problem of potentially leaving the phone behind and losing the phone. This device would solve this problem as it would inform the user that they have left their phone behind after they have travelled a set distance away thus preventing their phone from getting lost or stolen. This GPS tracking can be done with raspberry pi technology which is a cheap and easy to create solution to this problem.</p>
	<h2>Description of features: </h2>
	<p>The product would consist of one device that can be clipped to a pocket on a user’s pants or placed inside a bag. This phone then tracks the location of the device and will cause it to beep once they moved a sufficient distance apart.  The device would consist of a Raspberry pi with a GPS module which would send location data to the phone using the phone’s Wi-Fi hotspot. The phone would use the device’s location data and its own GPS location data to calculate their distance apart. The phone would then send a signal to the device when their distance apart exceeds the set distance. This signal would then be processed by the device which would then play a beeping sound through the built-in speakers. The user would need to install an app that would connect the tracker to the phone and turn on their phone Wi-Fi hotspot.  This app would allow the user to set the distance at which the device tracker would beep and the number of times it would beep before stopping. It will also allow the user to turn off the beeping if they decide to leave the phone behind. In the app the user can also configure the type of sound that the device makes to personalise it to meet their own tastes. If the user does not want to draw attention to themselves with a loud sound, they can reduce the volume of the sound that the device makes but also to change the device to a silent mode where it would vibrate. For the vibration the device would have a vibration motor linked to the Raspberry pi which would activate the vibration motor if it has received a signal from the phone. The vibration would also have separate settings in the app for strength and speed. Another feature of this device would be that once it has exceeded the set distance apart and it has started beeping or vibrating, the user can then press a button on the device, and it would change to a phone finder mode. In this mode the beeping or vibrating would be made to beep at a rate relative to the distance between the phone and the device. If the user has forgotten where they have last left their phone, this mode would make the device constantly beep or vibrate at changing speeds to indicate the proximity of the device from the phone. For example, if the user is approaching the phone and the distance between the devices are closing in the device would increase the speed at which it is beeping or vibrating while if they became further apart it would beep or vibrate slower. The phone would do this by calculating the initial distance between the phone and the device when the user has entered the phone finder mode and it would then increase the speed of the beeping by double the percentage of the total distance. For example, if the distance was 10 metres and the user moved 1 metre closer the beeping speed would increase by 20%. The tracker device can be charged using a micro-USB cable that would connect to a battery charger circuit that would connect to a battery. The battery charger circuit would convert the battery output to match the supply required by the Raspberry Pi.</p>
	<h2>Tools and technologies: </h2>
	<p>For hardware that would be required for the device it would it need a Raspberry Pi 4 for the computing, a Raspberry Pi GPS module for the location tracking, a mini metal speaker for the indication sounds, Raspberry Pi vibration motor for the vibration setting and a power supply with a built-in load-sharing battery charger circuit to enable the Raspberry Pi to be charged and run on a battery. A button switch would also be needed for the user to change to phone finder mode. More equipment that would be needed would include a soldering iron for connecting components with wires pliers for cutting wires and a screwdriver for securing the case. For creating the actual enclosure for the Raspberry Pi, a 3D printer would be needed to print the case. In terms of software the Raspberry Pi would follow code written in python and JavaScript for the device tracking features and the tracking app would also use python. Software for creating the 3D printer design such as Simplify3D or blender would also be needed. </p>
	<h2>Skills required and software that need to be written: </h2>
	<p>A skill required would be having knowledge of the python and java programming language specifically how to transmit location data and commands between a phone and installed modules in the Raspberry Pi through Wi-Fi. In addition to this, knowledge python GUI creation and design is required for the phone application. Some proficiency in using 3D printing design software is required for designing the device casing and knowledge of how to operate and print using a 3D printer is required. Skill with a soldering iron and an understanding of circuits is required for combining components and connecting wires. Software that would need to be written would be software for the Raspberry Pi that allows it to communicate with a phone using Wi-Fi. It would need to communicate its location data that is collected from the GPS module to the phone which would then have its own software in the form of an app that would receive the location data. The software in the phone would need to be able to take the location data from the phone and the device to calculate the distance. The app would need to have settings that the user can adjust such as minimum distance, sound, volume and vibration. It would then need to determine whether the distance exceeds the distance set in the app. If the distance does exceed the set distance, then the phone would transmit a command to the Raspberry Pi to play a repeating sound or vibrate according to setting on the app. The software in the Raspberry Pi would then receive the command and execute it using the mini speaker or vibration module. If the user presses the button on the Raspberry Pi during this the software would then need to send a message to the phone which would repeatedly send back a distance. The software would compare distances received and change the speed of vibration or beeping depending on whether the distance increases or decreases. </p>
	<h2>Outcome: </h2>
	<p>If the project is successful there would be potential for a commercially available device that can help prevent phones from being left behind or lost. The original problem was that it is common for people to leave their phones on a table or on their seat while they are sitting down and as a result it is often the case that they forget to pick up their phone and end up walking away and leaving it behind. This would not be a problem if they had a find my phone app which would tell them the location of their phone; However, if the phone were to be stolen it may be dangerous and risky to go and confront the thief to get the phone back. This device was meant to be a solution to this problem by preventing the phone from getting left behind in the first place thus eliminating the need to hunting for a lost phone. It would prevent the phone from being left behind by playing a beeping sound or vibration to inform the user that their phone was left behind if they travel a far enough distance away from their phone. The impact of solving this problem would be that it would lead to less phones being lost, left behind or stolen thus saving people time and money. </p>
	<h2>Inspiration/Reference Material:</h2>
	<p>The initial inspiration which started this idea for the project would be the apple air tag which is a device that can be attached to valuables and then tracked through the Find My App on iOS. From my personal experience I always felt paranoid about leaving my phone behind on a table and forgetting about it. When I saw the air tag, I thought that it would be too late to be using the Find My App to find the device as it may have been stolen and taken to a potentially dangerous location. Therefore, I thought of a device like the air tag in its tracking ability but also having a sound and vibration function and being attached to or nearby the user when they go out. So that in the event of the user forgetting their phone the device would inform them. On a blog post by Arijit Das, he made a Realtime GPS tracker with the Raspberry Pi. This gave me the idea to use a Raspberry Pi with a GPS module to get location data for the device. The idea to hotspot the phone and connect the Raspberry Pi to it to communicate data through Wi-Fi was from bensimmo in a Raspberry Pi forum about sending data from a Raspberry Pi to a mobile app. The YouTube video from “Core electronics” about RaspController showed a proof of concept for controlling a Raspberry Pi remotely using an app on a phone through Wi-Fi. The inspiration for using a portable battery for the Raspberry Pi came from a post on adafruit outlining a portable handheld Raspberry Pi notebook. </p>
