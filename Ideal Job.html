	<h2>Description of position</h2>
	<p>The position is for a systems engineer/administrator for the company CH talent solutions. In this position the administrator would need to manage and monitor all the infrastructure and installed systems of the company. They would need to conduct the installation, configuration, testing, and maintenance of operating systems, system management tools and application software. They are also responsible for the security, backup and redundancy strategies for these systems. Other responsibilities include writing custom scripts for improving system efficiency, giving IT support to other staff and resolve IT related issues. This position includes aspects of both cybersecurity and systems administration as part of the responsibilities.  This position appealed to me as currently I am interested in the IT fields of cybersecurity and systems administration. Some attractive extra feature of the job would be the flexible working environments and arrangements and the encouragement of growth and innovation. Another aspect that appealed to me was the wages for the job at $110,000 to $130,000 per annum. </p>
	<h2>Skills, qualification and experience required for the position</h2>
	<p>The engineer would need experience with Azure and AWS with 3+ years of experience with dealing with Linux based environments and working with MySQL or other similar databases. They need to have been exposed to the administration and performance tuning of application stacks, PowerBI pro, data-warehousing and ETL. They need experience with various things such as virtualization, containerization, monitoring systems, automation software, managing windows-based systems, managing MacOS desktop systems and experience with supporting staff with general IT issues along with troubleshooting 3rd party subscriptions. </p>
	<h2>Skills, qualifications and experience that I currently have </h2> 
	<p>Currently I do not have any experience with Azure and AWS nor have I dealt with Linux based environments or MySQL. I have not been exposed to the administration and performance tuning of application stacks, PowerBI pro, data-warehousing or ETL. I lack experience with virtualization, containerization, monitoring systems and automation software though I do have some experience with managing windows-based systems as my own computers use the windows operating system. However, I have not dealt with MacOS desktop systems and troubleshooting 3rd party subscriptions.  do have some experience with supporting people with general IT issues as I occasionally help my parents with their IT issues. I would have a long way to go to acquire the skills, qualifications and experience required for this position. </p>
	<h2>Plan of how to obtain the skills, qualification and experience required for the position. </h2>
	<p>For gaining experience with Azure, I would use Microsoft learn which has free online learning for Azure. For gaining experience with AWS, I would use AWS labs on qwiklabs.com for some practical experience. I would go through courses that would teach me how to use monitoring systems such as Amazon CloudWatch which can be taught through amazon. I would also find tutorials on how to learn automation software such as Rundeck to gain experience. For exposure to administration and performance tuning I would run through tutorials for applications such as JBoss. For exposure to PowerBI pro, data-warehousing and ETL I would go online and find tutorials on how to use each program. To obtain experience with dealing with Linux based environments and MySQL type databases, following the completion of my bachelorâ€™s degree I would look for an internship for an entry-level job at a company that is mainly Linux based and uses MySQL or similar databases. There they would teach me the skills required to operate and maintain such environments and databases. After the internship I may obtain a full-time position at the company and for several years I would work at that company and gain experience with virtualization and containerization. Then I would look for a position in another company that manages windows-based systems and has MacOS systems and requires me to help staff with general IT issues. </p>
